## 🎲 Game Rules

### Standard Mode

- Players take turns marking X and O on a 3×3 grid
- The first player to get 3 marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw

### Advanced Mode

- Similar to standard mode, but with an interesting twist
- Each player can only have 3 marks on the board at any time
- When you place a 4th mark, your oldest mark is automatically removed
- This creates a dynamic, strategic gameplay where the board state constantly changes
- Visual warnings indicate which mark will be removed next
